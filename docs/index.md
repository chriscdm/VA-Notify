# VA Notify

## 📖 Overview
Provides notification services via a REST API and a web application where teams can create / manage notification templates as needed; 
supports email, text, push notifications[^1], and onsite notifications[^2]; does not store any veteran information


## 🚪 Onboarding process 
Product teams submit an intake request and have a kickoff meeting with the VA Notify team; access to the web application is then manually 
provisioned, and teams may develop their notifications independently; a final touchpoint is required before launch
