# VA Notify

## Overview
Provides notification services via a REST API and a web application where teams can create / manage notification templates as needed; supports email, text, push notifications1, and onsite notifications; does not store any veteran information

## Onboarding process
Product teams submit an intake request and have a kickoff meeting with the VA Notify team; access to the web application is then manually provisioned, and teams may develop their notifications independently; a final touchpoint is required before launch

General self-service information is available via the VA Notify playbook, including code examples, sample notifications, and intake process; detailed API documentation is also available via Swagger

Supported languages and frameworks: Language and framework agnostic; notifications are sent via API calls
